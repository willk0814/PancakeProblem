# PancakeProblem
This program uses BFS and A* search to return the path taken to get to the goal stack of panckes.  The prorgam accepts a string in the form of #C#C#C#C-S.  Each # representing the pancakes size (1 being the smallest and 4 being the largest).  Each C represents a character, either w or b, representing whether the white side of the pancake is facing up or the burnt side.  The -S is a character representing which search algorithm to use, either a for A* or b for BFS.  The program then returns the path that the algorithm took with a "|" where the spatula would have gone for the flip.
